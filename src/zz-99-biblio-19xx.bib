abstract="We present an efficient interactive identification scheme and a related signature scheme that are based on discrete logarithms and which are particularly suited for smart cards. Previous cryptosystems, based on the discrete logarithm, have been proposed by El Gamal (1985), Chaum, Evertse, van de Graaf (1988), Beth (1988) and G{\"u}nther (1989). The new scheme comprises the following novel features.",

abstract="We consider complexity of perfect zero-knowledge arguments [4]. Let T denote the time needed to (deterministically) check a proof and let L denote an appropriate security parameter. We introduce new techniques for implementing very efficient zero-knowledge arguments. The resulting argument has the following features:The arguer can, if provided with the proof that can be deterministically checked in O(T) time, run in time O(TLO(1)). The best previous bound was O(T1+$\epsilon$LO(1)).The protocol can be simulated in time O(LO(1)). The best previous bound was O(T1+$\epsilon$LO(1)).A communication complexity of O(L lg L), where L is the security parameter against the prover. The best previous known bound was O(L lg T).",

abstract="For many proofs of knowledge it is important that only the verifier designated by the confirmer can obtain any conviction of the cor- rectness of the proof. A good example of such a situation is for undeniable signatures, where the confirmer of a signature wants to make sure that only the intended verifier(s) in fact can be convinced about the validity or invalidity of the signature.",

abstract="We present a general method for constructing commitment schemes based on existence of q-one way group homomorphisms, in which elements in a finite prime field GF(q) can be committed to. A receiver of commitments can non-interactively check whether committed values satisfy linear equations. Multiplicative relations can be verified interactively with exponentially small error, while communicating only a constant number of commitments. Particular assumptions sufficient for our commitment schemes include: the RSA assumption, hardness of discrete log in a prime order group, and polynomial security of Diffie-Hellman encryption.",
